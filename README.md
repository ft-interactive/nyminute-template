# Templates for the New York Minute

The New York Minute is a daily minute-long video from the FT's US markets team.

These templates are similar to the charts in the [FT's visual vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/visual-vocabulary).

More detailed instructions for how to make these charts, generate captions and produce the video are at [https://docs.google.com/a/ft.com/document/d/1E9tOKkCJ-RXmK1-c0VaW9RAYcyLwvVLkj-KM1l2-PNE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/a/ft.com/document/d/1E9tOKkCJ-RXmK1-c0VaW9RAYcyLwvVLkj-KM1l2-PNE/edit?usp=sharing) (internal to the FT)
